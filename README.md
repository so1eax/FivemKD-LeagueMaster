## Configuration

Edit the `config.lua` file to configure the following options:

\`\`\`lua
Config.Leagues = { -- You can change the number of points required for each leagues, and you can create as many leagues as you want.
    {name = "Bronze", pointsRequired = 499},
    {name = "Silver", pointsRequired = 999},
    {name = "Gold", pointsRequired = 1499},
    {name = "Platinum", pointsRequired = 2499},
    {name = "Diamond", pointsRequired = 3499},
    {name = "Master", pointsRequired = 4999},
    {name = "Grandmaster", pointsRequired = 7000},
}

Config.Commands = { -- You can enable / disable commands by setting the `enableCommand` to true / false, and change their names with the `commandName`
    resetKd = {
        enableCommand = true,
        commandName = "resetkd"
    },
    myKd = {
        enableCommand = true,
        commandName = "mykd"
    },
    myKills = {
        enableCommand = true,
        commandName = "mykills"
    },
    myDeaths = {
        enableCommand = true,
        commandName = "mydeaths"
    },
    myLeague = {
        enableCommand = true,
        commandName = "myleague"
    },
    killLeader = {
        enableCommand = true,
        commandName = "killleader"
    },
}

Config.Hud = {
    enableHud = true, -- true / false to enable / disable the player hud
    hudRefreshRate = 500, -- Refresh rate in milliseconds (0.5 seconds)
}
\`\`\`

## Exports

-- Client
- `exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerData()`
- `exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerKd()`
- `exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerLeague()`

-- Server
- `exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerData(playerServerId)`
- `exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerKd(playerServerId)`
- `exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerLeague(playerServerId)`

For the `GetPlayerData()` you can get the `player Unique ID` = .id, `player Identifier` = .identifier, `player Username` = .username, `player Kills` = .kills and the `player Deaths` = .deaths. To use these juste do like this : exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerData().id or exports.s1_kdsys:GetPlayerData(playerServerId).id for server exports.
